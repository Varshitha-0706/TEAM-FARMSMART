# 🌱 AI-Powered Agriculture Advisory System

## 📌 Problem Statement
Farmers in rural India face challenges in decision-making due to fragmented access to information on weather, pest outbreaks, and market prices.  
There is no intelligent platform that integrates real-time weather forecasts, pest management alerts, and personalized crop advisories into a single system.

## 🌍 Domain
**AI for Agriculture**

## 🚜 Features
This platform leverages **Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Geo-Advisory Systems** to empower farmers with data-driven insights:

1. **Pest & Disease Identification**  
   - Farmers can upload plant images.  
   - AI models detect pests or diseases and show confidence levels.  
   - Visualization with charts for easy interpretation.

2. **Pest Attack Prediction**  
   - Uses crop type, weather patterns, and historical pest data.  
   - Provides pest risk levels (High/Medium/Low) and preventive measures.

3. **Yield Monitoring & Forecasting**  
   - Predicts expected yield using soil data, weather conditions, and past yield records.  
   - Suggests optimal planting and harvesting schedules.

4. **Geo-Advisory**  
   - Location-based weather, soil, and crop recommendations.  
   - Real-time updates on rainfall, wind, humidity, and temperature.

5. **AI Voice Assistant**  
   - Farmers can ask questions in local languages.  
   - Provides voice-based responses for fertilizer guidance, pest control, and best practices.

## 🧠 Models Used
- **CNN (Convolutional Neural Networks)** – for pest & disease image recognition.  
- **Random Forest / Gradient Boosting** – for pest attack prediction.  
- **LSTM / Time-Series Forecasting Models** – for crop yield forecasting.  
- **NLP + TTS (Text-to-Speech)** – for voice assistant responses.  
- **Geo-Spatial Analysis Models** – for location-based advisory.

## 🖼️ Tech Stack
- **Frontend:** Next.js (React + Tailwind + shadcn/ui)  
- **Backend/AI Flows:** Node.js with integrated ML models  
- **Visualization:** Recharts, Lucide Icons  
- **AI/ML:** TensorFlow / PyTorch (for model training & inference)  

## 💡 Impact
- Helps farmers make **informed decisions** on crops, fertilizers, and pest management.  
- Reduces crop losses and increases yield productivity.  
- Brings multiple advisory systems into a **single intelligent platform**.
