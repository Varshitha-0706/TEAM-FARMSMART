## Getting Started with Git

To initialize a Git repository for your project and make your first commit, you can run the following commands in your terminal:

```bash
# 1. Initialize a new Git repository
git init

# 2. Add all files to the staging area
git add .

# 3. Commit the files with a message
git commit -m "Initial commit"
```

After this, you can connect it to a remote repository on a service like GitHub.
